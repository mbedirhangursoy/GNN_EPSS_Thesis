1296,CVE-2025-25284,,,,,ZOO-Project,"The ZOO-Project is an open source processing platform, released under MIT/X11 Licence. A vulnerability in ZOO-Project's WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation allows unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory through path traversal. Specifically, the Gdal_Translate service, when processing VRT (Virtual Format) files, does not properly validate file paths referenced in the VRTRasterBand element, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability exists because the service doesn't properly sanitize the SourceFilename parameter in VRT files, allowing relative path traversal sequences (../). When combined with VRT's raw data handling capabilities, this allows reading arbitrary files as raw binary data and converting them to TIFF format, effectively exposing their contents. This vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows attackers to read sensitive system files, potentially exposing configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information stored on the server. An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the system through path traversal, potentially accessing sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server. The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely through the WPS service. This issue has been addressed in commit `5f155a8` and all users are advised to upgrade.

A vulnerability present starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver. The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.

When creating an S3 storage connection, the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network.

Unless one hase implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application, then one will not be affected. The impact here for users using builtin functionality is that magic link tokens are reusable until they expire.

Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader, so those who use `mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication` will have the necessary patch applied. Otherwise, one may run the upgrader manually as described in the error message. As a workaround, delete the generated `:revoked?` generic action in the token resource.

Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked.

Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows SSRF due to DNS Rebinding in requests wrapper. AutoGPT is built with a wrapper around Python's requests library, hardening the application against SSRF. The code for this wrapper can be found in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. The requested hostname of a URL which is being requested is validated, ensuring that it does not resolve to any local ipv4 or ipv6 addresses. However, this check is not sufficient, as a DNS server may initially respond with a non-blocked address, with a TTL of 0. This means that the initial resolution would appear as a non-blocked address. In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0). This resolution may be in the ""invalid range"". This type of attack is called a ""DNS Rebinding Attack"". This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.",CWE-918

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",CWE-305

This vulnerability was previously reported in CVE-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. The original fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters can still be used for argument injection. The same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable: /Videos/<itemId>/stream and /Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>, likely alongside similar endpoints in AudioController. This argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system.

2074,CVE-2025-31492,,,,,OpenIDC,"mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED.

eth: bnxt: do not update checksum in bnxt_xdp_build_skb()

The bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value at the end if checksum offload
is enabled.
When the XDP-MB program is attached and it returns XDP_PASS, the
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is called to update skb_shared_info.
The main purpose of bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is to update skb_shared_info,
but it updates ip_summed value too if checksum offload is enabled.
This is actually duplicate work.

When the bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value, it checks if ip_summed
is CHECKSUM_NONE or not.
It means that ip_summed should be CHECKSUM_NONE at this moment.
But ip_summed may already be updated to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY in the
XDP-MB-PASS path.
So the by skb_checksum_none_assert() WARNS about it.

This is duplicate work and updating ip_summed in the
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is not needed.

2143,CVE-2025-21825,,,,,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Cancel the running bpf_timer through kworker for PREEMPT_RT

During the update procedure, when overwrite element in a pre-allocated
htab, the freeing of old_element is protected by the bucket lock. The
reason why the bucket lock is necessary is that the old_element has
already been stashed in htab->extra_elems after alloc_htab_elem()
returns. If freeing the old_element after the bucket lock is unlocked,
the stashed element may be reused by concurrent update procedure and the
freeing of old_element will run concurrently with the reuse of the
old_element. However, the invocation of check_and_free_fields() may
acquire a spin-lock which violates the lockdep rule because its caller
has already held a raw-spin-lock (bucket lock). The following warning
will be reported when such race happens:

It seems feasible to break the reuse and refill of per-cpu extra_elems
into two independent parts: reuse the per-cpu extra_elems with bucket
lock being held and refill the old_element as per-cpu extra_elems after
the bucket lock is unlocked. However, it will make the concurrent
overwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when
the map is full.

Therefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling
of bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT:
1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value
2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to
   cancel it again
Considering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try
to acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is
running, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has
downside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is
delayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable
(e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in
locked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if
necessary.

It is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the
problem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the
softirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced
in v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra
depends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.

       }

In the notify path after a ->set operation however, there's no request
attributes available.

The typical callsite for the above function looks like:

	phydev = ethnl_req_get_phydev(req_base, tb[ETHTOOL_A_XXX_HEADER],
				      info->extack);

So, when tb is NULL (such as in the ethnl notify path), we have a nice
crash.

It turns out that there's only the PLCA command that is in that case, as
the other phydev-specific commands don't have a notification.

This commit fixes the crash by passing the cmd index and the nlattr
array separately, allowing NULL-checking it directly inside the helper.",
2156,CVE-2025-21864,,,,,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we currently drop dst

Xiumei reported hitting the WARN in xfrm6_tunnel_net_exit while
running tests that boil down to:
 - create a pair of netns
 - run a basic TCP test over ipcomp6
 - delete the pair of netns

The xfrm_state found on spi_byaddr was not deleted at the time we
delete the netns, because we still have a reference on it. This
lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the
xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not
leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by
skb_attempt_defer_free.

The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's
defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In
that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't
expect at this point.

We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no
longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point,
tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the
secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those
places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we
cannot simply drop all extensions.",

The meta data for a mapped ring buffer contains an array of indexes of all

The validator currently makes sure that all the entries are within the

duplicates.

While working on the ring buffer, I corrupted this array, where I added
duplicates. The validator did not catch it and created the ring buffer
link list on top of it. Luckily, the corruption was only that the reader
page was also in the writer path and only presented corrupted data but did
not crash the kernel. But if there were duplicates in the writer side,
then it could corrupt the ring buffer link list and cause a crash.

Create a bitmask array with the size of the number of subbuffers. Then
clear it. When walking through the subbuf array checking to see if the
entries are within the range, test if its bit is already set in the
subbuf_mask. If it is, then there is duplicates and fail the validation.

x86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before ""getting"" registers

The x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers
are XSAVE-managed, but they are ""supervisor state components"" which means
that userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that
they are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.
Thus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.

The regset code that ptrace uses provides an ->active() handler in
addition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this ->active() handler
verifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the
thread struct. The ->active() handler is checked from some call sites of
the regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not
understood when shadow stack support was put in place.

As a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with
XFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to
return NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an
ssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack
behavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That
check just happened to avoid the warning.

But the ->get() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks
disabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina
Schimpe:

Ensure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up

set at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be
something to find in the XSAVE buffer.

rxrpc, afs: Fix peer hash locking vs RCU callback

In its address list, afs now retains pointers to and refs on one or more
rxrpc_peer objects.  The address list is freed under RCU and at this time,
it puts the refs on those peers.

Now, when an rxrpc_peer object runs out of refs, it gets removed from the
peer hash table and, for that, rxrpc has to take a spinlock.  However, it
is now being called from afs's RCU cleanup, which takes place in BH
context - but it is just taking an ordinary spinlock.

The put may also be called from non-BH context, and so there exists the
possibility of deadlock if the BH-based RCU cleanup happens whilst the hash
spinlock is held.  This led to the attached lockdep complaint.

Fix this by changing spinlocks of rxnet->peer_hash_lock back to
BH-disabling locks.

kernel: WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 6431 at kernel/irq/manage.c:920 irq_set_irq_wake+0x147/0x1a0

The PMC driver uses DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() to define its dev_pm_ops
which sets amd_pmc_suspend_handler() to the .suspend, .freeze, and
.poweroff handlers. i8042_pm_suspend(), however, is only set as
the .suspend handler.

Fix the issue by call PMC suspend handler only from the same set of
dev_pm_ops handlers as i8042_pm_suspend(), which currently means just
the .suspend handler.

To reproduce this issue try hibernating (S4) the machine after a fresh boot
without putting it into s2idle first.

net: sched: Disallow replacing of child qdisc from one parent to another

Lion Ackermann was able to create a UAF which can be abused for privilege
escalation with the following script

Step 1. create root qdisc
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1:0 drr

step2. a class for packet aggregation do demonstrate uaf
tc class add dev lo classid 1:1 drr

step3. a class for nesting
tc class add dev lo classid 1:2 drr

step4. a class to graft qdisc to
tc class add dev lo classid 1:3 drr

step5.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2:0 plug limit 1024

step6.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:2 handle 3:0 drr

step7.
tc class add dev lo classid 3:1 drr

step 8.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4:0 pfifo

step 9. Display the class/qdisc layout

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

step10. trigger the bug <=== prevented by this patch
tc qdisc replace dev lo parent 1:3 handle 4:0

step 11. Redisplay again the qdiscs/classes

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:3 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 refcnt 2 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

Observe that a) parent for 4:0 does not change despite the replace request.
There can only be one parent.  b) refcount has gone up by two for 4:0 and
c) both class 1:3 and 3:1 are pointing to it.

Step 12.  send one packet to plug
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10001))
step13.  send one packet to the grafted fifo
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10003))

step14. lets trigger the uaf
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:3
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1

The semantics of ""replace"" is for a del/add _on the same node_ and not
a delete from one node(3:1) and add to another node (1:3) as in step10.
While we could ""fix"" with a more complex approach there could be
consequences to expectations so the patch takes the preventive approach of
""disallow such config"".

timers/migration: Fix off-by-one root mis-connection

Before attaching a new root to the old root, the children counter of the
new root is checked to verify that only the upcoming CPU's top group have
been connected to it. However since the recently added commit b729cc1ec21a
(""timers/migration: Fix another race between hotplug and idle entry/exit"")
this check is not valid anymore because the old root is pre-accounted
as a child to the new root. Therefore after connecting the upcoming
CPU's top group to the new root, the children count to be expected must
be 2 and not 1 anymore.

This omission results in the old root to not be connected to the new
root. Then eventually the system may run with more than one top level,
which defeats the purpose of a single idle migrator.

Also the old root is pre-accounted but not connected upon the new root
creation. But it can be connected to the new root later on. Therefore
the old root may be accounted twice to the new root. The propagation of
such overcommit can end up creating a double final top-level root with a
groupmask incorrectly initialized. Although harmless given that the final
top level roots will never have a parent to walk up to, this oddity
opportunistically reported the core issue:

PCI: rcar-ep: Fix incorrect variable used when calling devm_request_mem_region()

The rcar_pcie_parse_outbound_ranges() uses the devm_request_mem_region()
macro to request a needed resource. A string variable that lives on the
stack is then used to store a dynamically computed resource name, which
is then passed on as one of the macro arguments. This can lead to
undefined behavior.

Depending on the current contents of the memory, the manifestations of
errors may vary. One possible output may be as follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem
  30000000-37ffffff :
  38000000-3fffffff :

Sometimes, garbage may appear after the colon.

In very rare cases, if no NULL-terminator is found in memory, the system
might crash because the string iterator will overrun which can lead to
access of unmapped memory above the stack.

Thus, fix this by replacing outbound_name with the name of the previously
requested resource. With the changes applied, the output will be as
follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem
  30000000-37ffffff : memory2

 *       are not supported with this feature. This feature
 *       cannot be set in features for a device with
 *       NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being

bpf: avoid holding freeze_mutex during mmap operation

We use map->freeze_mutex to prevent races between map_freeze() and
memory mapping BPF map contents with writable permissions. The way we
naively do this means we'll hold freeze_mutex for entire duration of all
the mm and VMA manipulations, which is completely unnecessary. This can
potentially also lead to deadlocks, as reported by syzbot in [0].

So, instead, hold freeze_mutex only during writeability checks, bump
(proactively) ""write active"" count for the map, unlock the mutex and
proceed with mmap logic. And only if something went wrong during mmap
logic, then undo that ""write active"" counter increment.

usb: atm: cxacru: fix a flaw in existing endpoint checks

Syzbot once again identified a flaw in usb endpoint checking, see [1].
This time the issue stems from a commit authored by me (2eabb655a968
(""usb: atm: cxacru: fix endpoint checking in cxacru_bind()"")).

While using usb_find_common_endpoints() may usually be enough to
discard devices with wrong endpoints, in this case one needs more
than just finding and identifying the sufficient number of endpoints
of correct types - one needs to check the endpoint's address as well.

Since cxacru_bind() fills URBs with CXACRU_EP_CMD address in mind,
switch the endpoint verification approach to usb_check_XXX_endpoints()
instead to fix incomplete ep testing.

vsock: Keep the binding until socket destruction

Preserve sockets bindings; this includes both resulting from an explicit
bind() and those implicitly bound through autobind during connect().

Prevents socket unbinding during a transport reassignment, which fixes a
use-after-free:

    1. vsock_create() (refcnt=1) calls vsock_insert_unbound() (refcnt=2)
    2. transport->release() calls vsock_remove_bound() without checking if
       sk was bound and moved to bound list (refcnt=1)
    3. vsock_bind() assumes sk is in unbound list and before
       __vsock_insert_bound(vsock_bound_sockets()) calls
       __vsock_remove_bound() which does:
           list_del_init(&vsk->bound_table); // nop
           sock_put(&vsk->sk);               // refcnt=0

Upon entering destroy_unused_implicit_child_mr(), the reference count
for the implicit MR parent is incremented using:
refcount_inc_not_zero().

A corresponding decrement must be performed if

The code has been updated to properly manage the reference count that

Commit c28c15b6d28a (""powerpc/code-patching: Use temporary mm for
Radix MMU"") is inspired from x86 but unlike x86 is doesn't disable
KASAN reports during patching. This wasn't a problem at the begining
because __patch_mem() is not instrumented.

Commit 465cabc97b42 (""powerpc/code-patching: introduce
patch_instructions()"") use copy_to_kernel_nofault() to copy several
instructions at once. But when using temporary mm the destination is
not regular kernel memory but a kind of kernel-like memory located
in user address space.

drm/xe: Fix tlb invalidation when wedging

If GuC fails to load, the driver wedges, but in the process it tries to
do stuff that may not be initialized yet. This moves the
xe_gt_tlb_invalidation_init() to be done earlier: as its own doc says,
it's a software-only initialization and should had been named with the
_early() suffix.

Move it to be called by xe_gt_init_early(), so the locks and seqno are
initialized, avoiding a NULL ptr deref when wedging:

	xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: load failed: status: Reset = 0, BootROM = 0x50, UKernel = 0x00, MIA = 0x00, Auth = 0x01

This can be easily triggered by poking the GuC binary to force a

This is because unregister_netdevice_many_notify might run before the
rtnl lock section of ethnl operations, eg. set_channels in the above
example. In this example the rss lock would be destroyed by the device
unregistration path before being used again, but in general running
ethnl operations while dismantle has started is not a good idea.

Fix this by denying any operation on devices being unregistered. A check
was already there in ethnl_ops_begin, but not wide enough.

Note that the same issue cannot be seen on the ioctl version
(__dev_ethtool) because the device reference is retrieved from within
the rtnl lock section there. Once dismantle started, the net device is
unlisted and no reference will be found.",

ipvlan: Fix use-after-free in ipvlan_get_iflink().

syzbot presented an use-after-free report [0] regarding ipvlan and
linkwatch.

ipvlan does not hold a refcnt of the lower device unlike vlan and
macvlan.

If the linkwatch work is triggered for the ipvlan dev, the lower dev
might have already been freed, resulting in UAF of ipvlan->phy_dev in
ipvlan_get_iflink().

We can delay the lower dev unregistration like vlan and macvlan by
holding the lower dev's refcnt in dev->netdev_ops->ndo_init() and
releasing it in dev->priv_destructor().

Jakub pointed out calling .ndo_XXX after unregister_netdevice() has
returned is error prone and suggested [1] addressing this UAF in the
core by taking commit 750e51603395 (""net: avoid potential UAF in
default_operstate()"") further.

Let's assume unregistering devices DOWN and use RCU protection in
default_operstate() not to race with the device unregistration.

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix freeing IRQ in am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()

When getting the IRQ we use k3_udma_glue_tx_get_irq() which returns
negative error value on error. So not NULL check is not sufficient
to deteremine if IRQ is valid. Check that IRQ is greater then zero
to ensure it is valid.

There is no issue at probe time but at runtime user can invoke
.set_channels which results in the following call chain.
am65_cpsw_set_channels()
 am65_cpsw_nuss_update_tx_rx_chns()
  am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()

At this point if am65_cpsw_nuss_init_tx_chns() fails due to
k3_udma_glue_tx_get_irq() then tx_chn->irq will be set to a
negative value.

Then, at subsequent .set_channels with higher channel count we
will attempt to free an invalid IRQ in am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()
leading to a kernel warning.

nilfs2: handle errors that nilfs_prepare_chunk() may return

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix issues with rename operations"".

This series fixes BUG_ON check failures reported by syzbot around rename
operations, and a minor behavioral issue where the mtime of a child
directory changes when it is renamed instead of moved.


This patch (of 2):

The directory manipulation routines nilfs_set_link() and
nilfs_delete_entry() rewrite the directory entry in the folio/page
previously read by nilfs_find_entry(), so error handling is omitted on the
assumption that nilfs_prepare_chunk(), which prepares the buffer for
rewriting, will always succeed for these.  And if an error is returned, it
triggers the legacy BUG_ON() checks in each routine.

This assumption is wrong, as proven by syzbot: the buffer layer called by
nilfs_prepare_chunk() may call nilfs_get_block() if necessary, which may
fail due to metadata corruption or other reasons.  This has been there all
along, but improved sanity checks and error handling may have made it more
reproducible in fuzzing tests.

Fix this issue by adding missing error paths in nilfs_set_link(),
nilfs_delete_entry(), and their caller nilfs_rename().",

dm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function

The documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()
and cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() ->
list_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these
functions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead
to a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the
subsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a
modification.

In the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP
fault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list
head in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and
turned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the
list was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this
occurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and
a UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,
prior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it
was possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's
synchronize_rcu.

The thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins
list (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just
the wrong moment which lead to this crash.

Fortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()
function to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single
READ_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.

This was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning
suites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",

vlan: enforce underlying device type

Currently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.

Besides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes a
bug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.

When creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)
and MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.

As part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address of
each applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.

__dev_mc_add uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the new
multicast address.

This causes an out-of-bounds read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6,
since the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6
bytes long.

This behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:

ip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo
ip l set up dev gretest
ip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100

Then, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:

ip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21

device initialization.",

gtp: Suppress list corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl().

Brad Spengler reported the list_del() corruption splat in
gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). [0]

Commit eb28fd76c0a0 (""gtp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns
dismantle."") added the for_each_netdev() loop in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl()
to destroy devices in each netns as done in geneve and ip tunnels.

However, this could trigger ->dellink() twice for the same device during
->exit_batch_rtnl().

Say we have two netns A & B and gtp device B that resides in netns B but
whose UDP socket is in netns A.

  1. cleanup_net() processes netns A and then B.

  2. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns A's gn->gtp_dev_list and calls ->dellink().

  [ device B is not yet unlinked from netns B
    as unregister_netdevice_many() has not been called. ]

  3. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns B's for_each_netdev() and calls ->dellink().

gtp_dellink() cleans up the device's hash table, unlinks the dev from
gn->gtp_dev_list, and calls unregister_netdevice_queue().

Basically, calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled.

Let's remove for_each_netdev() in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() and
delegate the destruction to default_device_exit_batch() as done
in bareudp.

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Fix hang in kdump kernel when on Hyper-V Gen 2 VMs

Gen 2 Hyper-V VMs boot via EFI and have a standard EFI framebuffer
device. When the kdump kernel runs in such a VM, loading the efifb
driver may hang because of accessing the framebuffer at the wrong
memory address.

The scenario occurs when the hyperv_fb driver in the original kernel
moves the framebuffer to a different MMIO address because of conflicts
with an already-running efifb or simplefb driver. The hyperv_fb driver
then informs Hyper-V of the change, which is allowed by the Hyper-V FB
VMBus device protocol. However, when the kexec command loads the kdump
kernel into crash memory via the kexec_file_load() system call, the
system call doesn't know the framebuffer has moved, and it sets up the
kdump screen_info using the original framebuffer address. The transition
to the kdump kernel does not go through the Hyper-V host, so Hyper-V
does not reset the framebuffer address like it would do on a reboot.
When efifb tries to run, it accesses a non-existent framebuffer
address, which traps to the Hyper-V host. After many such accesses,
the Hyper-V host thinks the guest is being malicious, and throttles
the guest to the point that it runs very slowly or appears to have hung.

When the kdump kernel is loaded into crash memory via the kexec_load()
system call, the problem does not occur. In this case, the kexec command
builds the screen_info table itself in user space from data returned
by the FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO ioctl against /dev/fb0, which gives it the
new framebuffer location.

This problem was originally reported in 2020 [1], resulting in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a (""hyperv_fb: Update screen_info after removing old
framebuffer""). This commit solved the problem by setting orig_video_isVGA
to 0, so the kdump kernel was unaware of the EFI framebuffer. The efifb
driver did not try to load, and no hang occurred. But in 2024, commit
c25a19afb81c (""fbdev/hyperv_fb: Do not clear global screen_info"")
effectively reverted 3cb73bc3fa2a. Commit c25a19afb81c has no reference
to 3cb73bc3fa2a, so perhaps it was done without knowing the implications
that were reported with 3cb73bc3fa2a. In any case, as of commit
c25a19afb81c, the original problem came back again.

Interestingly, the hyperv_drm driver does not have this problem because
it never moves the framebuffer. The difference is that the hyperv_drm
driver removes any conflicting framebuffers *before* allocating an MMIO
address, while the hyperv_fb drivers removes conflicting framebuffers
*after* allocating an MMIO address. With the ""after"" ordering, hyperv_fb
may encounter a conflict and move the framebuffer to a different MMIO
address. But the conflict is essentially bogus because it is removed
a few lines of code later.

Rather than fix the problem with the approach from 2020 in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a, instead slightly reorder the steps in hyperv_fb so
conflicting framebuffers are removed before allocating an MMIO address.
Then the default framebuffer MMIO address should always be available, and
there's never any confusion about which framebuffer address the kdump
kernel should use -- it's always the original address provided by
the Hyper-V host. This approach is already used by the hyperv_drm
driver, and is consistent with the usage guidelines at the head of
the module with the function aperture_remove_conflicting_devices().

This approach also solves a related minor problem when kexec_load()
is used to load the kdump kernel. With current code, unbinding and
rebinding the hyperv_fb driver could result in the framebuffer moving
back to the default framebuffer address, because on the rebind there
are no conflicts. If such a move is done after the kdump kernel is
loaded with the new framebuffer address, at kdump time it could again
have the wrong address.

This problem and fix are described in terms of the kdump kernel, but
it can also occur

bnxt_xdp_build_skb().
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() passes incorrect truesize argument to
xdp_update_skb_shared_info().
The truesize is calculated as BNXT_RX_PAGE_SIZE * sinfo->nr_frags but
the skb_shared_info was wiped by napi_build_skb() before.
So it stores sinfo->nr_frags before bnxt_xdp_build_skb() and use it
instead of getting skb_shared_info from xdp_get_shared_info_from_buff().

sched_ext: Fix pick_task_scx() picking non-queued tasks when it's called without balance()

a6250aa251ea (""sched_ext: Handle cases where pick_task_scx() is called
without preceding balance_scx()"") added a workaround to handle the cases
where pick_task_scx() is called without prececing balance_scx() which is due
to a fair class bug where pick_taks_fair() may return NULL after a true
return from balance_fair().

The workaround detects when pick_task_scx() is called without preceding
balance_scx() and emulates SCX_RQ_BAL_KEEP and triggers kicking to avoid
stalling. Unfortunately, the workaround code was testing whether @prev was
on SCX to decide whether to keep the task running. This is incorrect as the
task may be on SCX but no longer runnable.

This could lead to a non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()
which cause interesting confusions and failures. e.g. A common failure mode
is the task ending up with (!on_rq && on_cpu) state which can cause
potential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks.

Fix it by testing whether @prev has SCX_TASK_QUEUED set. This makes
@prev_on_scx only used in one place. Open code the usage and improve the
comment while at it.",

i2c: npcm: disable interrupt enable bit before devm_request_irq

The customer reports that there is a soft lockup issue related to
the i2c driver. After checking, the i2c module was doing a tx transfer
and the bmc machine reboots in the middle of the i2c transaction, the i2c
module keeps the status without being reset.

Due to such an i2c module status, the i2c irq handler keeps getting
triggered since the i2c irq handler is registered in the kernel booting
process after the bmc machine is doing a warm rebooting.
The continuous triggering is stopped by the soft lockup watchdog timer.

Disable the interrupt enable bit in the i2c module before calling
devm_request_irq to fix this issue since the i2c relative status bit
is read-only.

Here is the soft lockup log.

tcp: correct handling of extreme memory squeeze

Testing with iperf3 using the ""pasta"" protocol splicer has revealed
a problem in the way tcp handles window advertising in extreme memory
squeeze situations.

Under memory pressure, a socket endpoint may temporarily advertise
a zero-sized window, but this is not stored as part of the socket data.
The reasoning behind this is that it is considered a temporary setting
which shouldn't influence any further calculations.

However, if we happen to stall at an unfortunate value of the current
window size, the algorithm selecting a new value will consistently fail
to advertise a non-zero window once we have freed up enough memory.
This means that this side's notion of the current window size is
different from the one last advertised to the peer, causing the latter
to not send any data to resolve the sitution.

The problem occurs on the iperf3 server side, and the socket in question
is a completely regular socket with the default settings for the
fedora40 kernel. We do not use SO_PEEK or SO_RCVBUF on the socket.

The following excerpt of a logging session, with own comments added,

KVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on
VM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs
at will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint
only generates one VM-Exit.

For DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also
identical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)
and KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading
DR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.

But for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for
KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas
VMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the
guest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done
_inside_ the core run loop.

Unfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common
x86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in
hardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is
a fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu->arch.dr6 and
clobber the guest's actual value.

The bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX
preemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6
being modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is
orders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the
VMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection
and the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the
window where hardware DR6 is ""dirty"" extends all the way from L1 writing
DR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).

netfs: Fix kernel async DIO

Netfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO that
is supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,
this gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning and
fails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.  This can be
triggered through a combination of cifs and a loopback blockdev with
something like:

        mount //my/cifs/share /foo
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/foo/m0 bs=4K count=1K
        losetup --sector-size 4096 --direct-io=on /dev/loop2046 /foo/m0
        echo hello >/dev/loop2046

This causes the following to appear in syslog:

        WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 109 at fs/netfs/iterator.c:50 netfs_extract_user_iter+0x170/0x250 [netfs]

and the write to fail.

Fix this by removing the check in netfs_unbuffered_write_iter_locked() that
causes async kernel DIO writes to be handled as userspace writes.  Note
that this change relies on the kernel caller maintaining the existence of
the bio_vec array (or kvec[] or folio_queue) until the op is complete.",

The cause is that zero pfn is set to the PTE without increasing the RSS
count in mfill_atomic_pte_zeropage() and the refcount of zero folio does
not increase accordingly. Then, the operation on the same pfn is performed
in uprobe_write_opcode()->__replace_page() to unconditional decrease the
RSS count and old_folio's refcount.

Therefore, two bugs are introduced:

 1. The RSS count is incorrect, when process exit, the check_mm() report
    error ""Bad rss-count"".

 2. The reserved folio (zero folio) is freed when folio->refcount is zero,
    then free_pages_prepare->free_page_is_bad() report error
    ""Bad page state"".

There is more, the following warning could also theoretically be triggered:

  __replace_page()
    -> ...
      -> folio_remove_rmap_pte()
        -> VM_WARN_ON_FOLIO(is_zero_folio(folio), folio)

Considering that uprobe hit on the zero folio is a very rare case, just
reject zero old folio immediately after get_user_page_vma_remote().

net/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect

Currently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,
the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns
an error, which continues running the calling function and eventually
frees the matcher that is being disconnected.
This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,
which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.

This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when
some FW command fails during disconnect.

Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this
problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection
between matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is
the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.

Fix two bugs during folio migration if the folio is poisoned.


This patch (of 3):

Commit 6da6b1d4a7df (""mm/hwpoison: convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON to
TTU_HWPOISON"") introduce TTU_HWPOISON to replace TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON in
order to stop send SIGBUS signal when accessing an error page after a
memory error on a clean folio.  However during page migration, anon folio
must be set with TTU_HWPOISON during unmap_*().  For pagecache we need
some policy just like the one in hwpoison_user_mappings to set this flag. 
So move this policy from hwpoison_user_mappings to unmap_poisoned_folio to
handle this warning properly.

As mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'

- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only
  from the opener's netns.

- current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'

  syzbot [1] using acct(2).

The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using

increase the size of this fix, while 'sctp.ctl_sock' still needs to be

ax25: Fix refcount leak caused by setting SO_BINDTODEVICE sockopt

If an AX25 device is bound to a socket by setting the SO_BINDTODEVICE
socket option, a refcount leak will occur in ax25_release().

Commit 9fd75b66b8f6 (""ax25: Fix refcount leaks caused by ax25_cb_del()"")
added decrement of device refcounts in ax25_release(). In order for that
to work correctly the refcounts must already be incremented when the
device is bound to the socket. An AX25 device can be bound to a socket
by either calling ax25_bind() or setting SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option.
In both cases the refcounts should be incremented, but in fact it is done
only in ax25_bind().

This bug leads to the following issue reported by Syzkaller:

sockmap, vsock: For connectible sockets allow only connected

sockmap expects all vsocks to have a transport assigned, which is expressed
in vsock_proto::psock_update_sk_prot(). However, there is an edge case
where an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned
transport. This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.

Another design detail is that listening vsocks are not supposed to have any
transport assigned at all. Which implies they are not supported by the
sockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before
switching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a
failed connect() attempt. Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a
sockmap, which blows up quickly:

acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes(), and acpi_ut_acquire_mutex() may cause

dm-integrity: Avoid divide by zero in table status in Inline mode

In Inline mode, the journal is unused, and journal_sectors is zero.

Calculating the journal watermark requires dividing by journal_sectors,
which should be done only if the journal is configured.

Otherwise, a simple table query (dmsetup table) can cause OOPS.

This bug did not show on some systems, perhaps only due to
compiler optimization.

batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker

The ELP worker needs to calculate new metric values for all neighbors
""reachable"" over an interface. Some of the used metric sources require
locks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU
list iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work
around of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then
run this in a new context.

Even when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major
problems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed
anymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or
the batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory
accesses.

Directly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:

* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with
  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use
  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that
  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker
  to finish.
* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is
  currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is
  possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated
  spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check
  but not for a cleanup routine (which must ""stop"" all still running
  workers)

The better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric
worker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems
are solved by:

* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside
  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list
  outside the RCU protected context
* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock
  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code
  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)",

net/mlx5: Bridge, fix the crash caused by LAG state check

When removing LAG device from bridge, NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER event is
triggered. Driver finds the lower devices (PFs) to flush all the
offloaded entries. And mlx5_lag_is_shared_fdb is checked, it returns
false if one of PF is unloaded. In such case,
mlx5_esw_bridge_lag_rep_get() and its caller return NULL, instead of
the alive PF, and the flush is skipped.

Besides, the bridge fdb entry's lastuse is updated in mlx5 bridge
event handler. But this SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_BRIDGE event can be
ignored in this case because the upper interface for bond is deleted,
and the entry will never be aged because lastuse is never updated.

To make things worse, as the entry is alive, mlx5 bridge workqueue
keeps sending that event, which is then handled by kernel bridge
notifier. It causes the following crash when accessing the passed bond
netdev which is already destroyed.

To fix this issue, remove such checks. LAG state is already checked in
commit 15f8f168952f (""net/mlx5: Bridge, verify LAG state when adding
bond to bridge""), driver still need to skip offload if LAG becomes
invalid state after initialization.

sched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection

scx_move_task() is called from sched_move_task() and tells the BPF scheduler
that cgroup migration is being committed. sched_move_task() is used by both
cgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out
autogroup migrations by testing the destination cgroup and PF_EXITING but
this is not enough. In fact, without explicitly tagging the thread which is
doing the cgroup migration, there is no good way to tell apart
scx_move_task() invocations for racing migration to the root cgroup and an
autogroup migration.

This led to scx_move_task() incorrectly ignoring a migration from non-root
cgroup to an autogroup of the root cgroup triggering the following warning:

Fix it by adding an argument to sched_move_task() that indicates whether the

				kernfs_put_active

This warning is caused by 'kernfs_break_active_protection' when it is
writing to cpuset.cpus, and the cgroup is removed concurrently.

The commit 3a5a6d0c2b03 (""cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside
get_online_cpus()"") made cpuset_hotplug_workfn asynchronous, This change
involves calling flush_work(), which can create a multiple processes
circular locking dependency that involve cgroup_mutex, potentially leading
to a deadlock. To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (""cpuset: break
kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()"") added
'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could
lead to this warning.

After the commit 2125c0034c5d (""cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug
processing synchronous""), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to
wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset
operations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist
anymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this
warning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the
'cpuset_write_resmask'.",

The following bug report happened with a PREEMPT_RT kernel:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 2012, name: kwatchdog

It is due to the fact that clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() is invoked with
preemption disabled.  This function invokes get_random_u32() to obtain
random numbers for choosing CPUs.  The batched_entropy_32 local lock and/or
the base_crng.lock spinlock in driver/char/random.c will be acquired during
the call. In PREEMPT_RT kernel, they are both sleeping locks and so cannot
be acquired in atomic context.

Fix this problem by using migrate_disable() to allow smp_processor_id() to
be reliably used without introducing atomic context. preempt_disable() is
then called after clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() but before the
clocksource measurement is being run to avoid introducing unexpected
latency.",

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases

If the XDP program doesn't result in XDP_PASS then we leak the

It is pointless to allocate SKB memory before running the XDP
program as we would be wasting CPU cycles for cases other than XDP_PASS.
Move the SKB allocation after evaluating the XDP program result.

This fixes the memleak. A performance boost is seen for XDP_DROP test.

geneve: Fix use-after-free in geneve_find_dev().

syzkaller reported a use-after-free in geneve_find_dev() [0]
without repro.

geneve_configure() links struct geneve_dev.next to
net_generic(net, geneve_net_id)->geneve_list.

The net here could differ from dev_net(dev) if IFLA_NET_NS_PID,
IFLA_NET_NS_FD, or IFLA_TARGET_NETNSID is set.

When dev_net(dev) is dismantled, geneve_exit_batch_rtnl() finally
calls unregister_netdevice_queue() for each dev in the netns,
and later the dev is freed.

However, its geneve_dev.next is still linked to the backend UDP
socket netns.

Then, use-after-free will occur when another geneve dev is created
in the netns.

Let's call geneve_dellink() instead in geneve_destroy_tunnels().

If 'mdelay(10)' is added before calling 'padata_find_next' in the
'padata_reorder' function, this issue could be reproduced easily with
ltp test (pcrypt_aead01).

This can be explained as bellow:

pcrypt_aead_encrypt
...
padata_do_parallel
refcount_inc(&pd->refcnt); // add refcnt
...
padata_do_serial
padata_reorder // pd
while (1) {
padata_find_next(pd, true); // using pd
queue_work_on
...
padata_serial_worker				crypto_del_alg
padata_put_pd_cnt // sub refcnt
						padata_free_shell
						padata_put_pd(ps->pd);
						// pd is freed
// loop again, but pd is freed
// call padata_find_next, UAF
}

In the padata_reorder function, when it loops in 'while', if the alg is
deleted, the refcnt may be decreased to 0 before entering
'padata_find_next', which leads to UAF.

As mentioned in [1], do_serial is supposed to be called with BHs disabled
and always happen under RCU protection, to address this issue, add
synchronize_rcu() in 'padata_free_shell' wait for all _do_serial calls
to finish.

net: gso: fix ownership in __udp_gso_segment

In __udp_gso_segment the skb destructor is removed before segmenting the
skb but the socket reference is kept as-is. This is an issue if the
original skb is later orphaned as we can hit the following bug:

   goes through queue_gso_packets and then __udp_gso_segment, where its
   destructor is removed.
2. The segments' data are copied and sent to userspace.
3. OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT is handled (in do_execute_actions) and the
   same original skb is sent to its path.

seccomp: passthrough uretprobe systemcall without filtering

When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside docker, the attached
process is segfaulted when encountering the retprobe.

The reason is that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp
filters in docker block it as they only allow a specific set of known
syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp
to control their syscall surface.

Since uretprobe is a ""kernel implementation detail"" system call which is
not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and
there's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to
explicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.

Pass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.

Note: uretprobe is currently only x86_64 and isn't expected to ever be
supported in i386.

   </TASK>

[CAUSE]
The reproducer is using a corrupted image where extent tree root is
corrupted, thus forcing to use ""rescue=all,ro"" mount option to mount the
image.

Then it triggered a scrub, but since scrub relies on extent tree to find
where the data/metadata extents are, scrub_find_fill_first_stripe()
relies on an non-empty extent root.

But unfortunately scrub_find_fill_first_stripe() doesn't really expect
an NULL pointer for extent root, it use extent_root to grab fs_info and
triggered a NULL pointer dereference.

[FIX]
Add an extra check for a valid extent root at the beginning of
scrub_find_fill_first_stripe().

The new error path is introduced by 42437a6386ff (""btrfs: introduce
mount option rescue=ignorebadroots""), but that's pretty old, and later
commit b979547513ff (""btrfs: scrub: introduce helper to find and fill
sector info for a scrub_stripe"") changed how we do scrub.

So for kernels older than 6.6, the fix will need manual backport.",

wifi: cfg80211: regulatory: improve invalid hints checking

Syzbot keeps reporting an issue [1] that occurs when erroneous symbols
sent from userspace get through into user_alpha2[] via
regulatory_hint_user() call. Such invalid regulatory hints should be
rejected.

While a sanity check from commit 47caf685a685 (""cfg80211: regulatory:
reject invalid hints"") looks to be enough to deter these very cases,
there is a way to get around it due to 2 reasons.

1) The way isalpha() works, symbols other than latin lower and
upper letters may be used to determine a country/domain.
For instance, greek letters will also be considered upper/lower
letters and for such characters isalpha() will return true as well.
However, ISO-3166-1 alpha2 codes should only hold latin
characters.

2) While processing a user regulatory request, between
reg_process_hint_user() and regulatory_hint_user() there happens to
be a call to queue_regulatory_request() which modifies letters in
request->alpha2[] with toupper(). This works fine for latin symbols,
less so for weird letter characters from the second part of _ctype[].

Syzbot triggers a warning in is_user_regdom_saved() by first sending
over an unexpected non-latin letter that gets malformed by toupper()
into a character that ends up failing isalpha() check.

Prevent this by enhancing is_an_alpha2() to ensure that incoming
symbols are latin letters and nothing else.

openvswitch: fix lockup on tx to unregistering netdev with carrier

Commit in a fixes tag attempted to fix the issue in the following
sequence of calls:

    do_output
    -> ovs_vport_send
       -> dev_queue_xmit
          -> __dev_queue_xmit
             -> netdev_core_pick_tx
                -> skb_tx_hash

When device is unregistering, the 'dev->real_num_tx_queues' goes to
zero and the 'while (unlikely(hash >= qcount))' loop inside the
'skb_tx_hash' becomes infinite, locking up the core forever.

But unfortunately, checking just the carrier status is not enough to
fix the issue, because some devices may still be in unregistering
state while reporting carrier status OK.

One example of such device is a net/dummy.  It sets carrier ON
on start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.
And it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.
Therefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit
the infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There
might be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is
important for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a
packet sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the
issue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.

Fix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running
state is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers
unregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets
to devices that are not running anyway.

While only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier
check is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined
throughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions
like __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit
a packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well.",

bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid deadlock

There are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduled
asynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waits
synchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is during
the PM shutdown() callback.

If the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset the
device using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take the
device_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lock
has already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled while
waiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the caller
which waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead to
deadlock.

This is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device died
before shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the driver's shutdown()
callback while holding the device_lock() leading to deadlock.

And this deadlock scenario can occur on other paths as well, like during
the PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold the
device_lock() before calling driver's suspend() callback. And if the
recovery_work was already started, it could lead to deadlock. This is also
observed on the X1E80100 CRD.

So to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. This
function first checks for the availability of the device_lock() before
trying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire it
and reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens,
recovery_work will fail with the error message ""Recovery failed"" as not
much could be done.",

drm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling

Currently we treat EFAULT from hmm_range_fault() as a non-fatal error
when called from xe_vm_userptr_pin() with the idea that we want to avoid
killing the entire vm and chucking an error, under the assumption that
the user just did an unmap or something, and has no intention of
actually touching that memory from the GPU.  At this point we have
already zapped the PTEs so any access should generate a page fault, and
if the pin fails there also it will then become fatal.

However it looks like it's possible for the userptr vma to still be on
the rebind list in preempt_rebind_work_func(), if we had to retry the
pin again due to something happening in the caller before we did the
rebind step, but in the meantime needing to re-validate the userptr and
this time hitting the EFAULT.

This explains an internal user report of hitting:

Followed by NPD, when running some workload, since the sg was never
actually populated but the vma is still marked for rebind when it should
be skipped for this special EFAULT case. This is confirmed to fix the
user report.

 - Move earlier.
v3 (MattB):
 - Update the commit message to make it clear that this indeed fixes the

mptcp: sysctl: sched: avoid using current->nsproxy

Using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different
reasons.

First, if the goal is to use it to read or write per-netns data, this is
inconsistent with how the ""generic"" sysctl entries are doing: directly
by only using pointers set to the table entry, e.g. table->data. Linked
to that, the per-netns data should always be obtained from the table
linked to the netns it had been created for, which may not coincide with
the reader's or writer's netns.

Another reason is that access to current->nsproxy->netns can oops if
attempted when current->nsproxy had been dropped when the current task
is exiting. This is what syzbot found, when using acct(2):

MPTCP maintains the received sub-options status is the bitmask carrying
the received suboptions and in several bitfields carrying per suboption

depending on the actually parsed suboption.

The above schema is fragile, and syzbot managed to trigger a path where

ovl: support encoding fid from inode with no alias

Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN_ON() assertion can be trigered by
userspace when calling inotify_show_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched
inode, whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop_caches.

The WARN_ON() assertion in inotify_show_fdinfo() was removed, because
it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason, but
the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond
this assertion.

As shown in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below, failure to
encode an overlayfs file handle from a non-aliased inode also leads to
failure to report an fid with FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.

As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem, ovl_encode_fh() fails
if it cannot find an alias for the inode, but this failure can be fixed.
ovl_encode_fh() seldom uses the alias and in the case of non-decodable
file handles, as is often the case with fanotify fid info,
ovl_encode_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle.

Defer finding an alias until it is actually needed so ovl_encode_fh()
will not fail in the common case of FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.",

mm: fix kernel BUG when userfaultfd_move encounters swapcache

userfaultfd_move() checks whether the PTE entry is present or a
swap entry.

- If the PTE entry is present, move_present_pte() handles folio
  migration by setting:

  src_folio->index = linear_page_index(dst_vma, dst_addr);

- If the PTE entry is a swap entry, move_swap_pte() simply copies
  the PTE to the new dst_addr.

This approach is incorrect because, even if the PTE is a swap entry,
it can still reference a folio that remains in the swap cache.

This creates a race window between steps 2 and 4.
 1. add_to_swap: The folio is added to the swapcache.
 2. try_to_unmap: PTEs are converted to swap entries.
 3. pageout: The folio is written back.
 4. Swapcache is cleared.
If userfaultfd_move() occurs in the window between steps 2 and 4,
after the swap PTE has been moved to the destination, accessing the
destination triggers do_swap_page(), which may locate the folio in
the swapcache. However, since the folio's index has not been updated
to match the destination VMA, do_swap_page() will detect a mismatch.

This can result in two critical issues depending on the system
configuration.

If KSM is disabled, both small and large folios can trigger a BUG
during the add_rmap operation due to:

fuse: revert back to __readahead_folio() for readahead

In commit 3eab9d7bc2f4 (""fuse: convert readahead to use folios""), the
logic was converted to using the new folio readahead code, which drops
the reference on the folio once it is locked, using an inferred
reference on the folio. Previously we held a reference on the folio for
the entire duration of the readpages call.

This is fine, however for the case for splice pipe responses where we
will remove the old folio and splice in the new folio (see
fuse_try_move_page()), we assume that there is a reference held on the
folio for ap->folios, which is no longer the case.

To fix this, revert back to __readahead_folio() which allows us to hold
the reference on the folio for the duration of readpages until either we
drop the reference ourselves in fuse_readpages_end() or the reference is
dropped after it's replaced in the page cache in the splice case.

thermal/netlink: Prevent userspace segmentation fault by adjusting UAPI header

The intel-lpmd tool [1], which uses the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY
attribute to receive HFI events from kernel space, encounters a
segmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 (""thermal: netlink: Add the
commands and the events for the thresholds"").

The issue arises because the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY raw value
was changed while intel_lpmd still uses the old value.

Although intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION and
use the appropriate THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY value, the commit
itself is questionable.

The commit introduced a new element in the middle of enum thermal_genl_attr,
which affects many existing attributes and introduces potential risks
and unnecessary maintenance burdens for userspace thermal netlink event
users.

Solve the issue by moving the newly introduced
THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_TZ_PREV_TEMP attribute to the end of the
enum thermal_genl_attr. This ensures that all existing thermal generic
netlink attributes remain unaffected.

The fact that HW-GRO doesn't get re-enabled automatically is just

btrfs: fix use-after-free when attempting to join an aborted transaction

When we are trying to join the current transaction and if it's aborted,
we read its 'aborted' field after unlocking fs_info->trans_lock and

concurrent task that is aborting the transaction may free the transaction
before we read its 'aborted' field, leading to a use-after-free.

Fix this by reading the 'aborted' field while holding fs_info->trans_lock

fs_info->running_transaction to NULL before freeing the transaction.

x86/microcode/AMD: Fix out-of-bounds on systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes

Currently, load_microcode_amd() iterates over all NUMA nodes, retrieves their
CPU masks and unconditionally accesses per-CPU data for the first CPU of each
mask.

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst:

  ""Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as
  memory only nodes.""

Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a ""first CPU"".

On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes):
- cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0
- cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS
- cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an
  index that is 1 out of bounds

This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is
a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by
potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.

When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashes
a microcode update. I get the following splat:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y

perf/core: Order the PMU list to fix warning about unordered pmu_ctx_list

Syskaller triggers a warning due to prev_epc->pmu != next_epc->pmu in
perf_event_swap_task_ctx_data(). vmcore shows that two lists have the same
perf_event_pmu_context, but not in the same order.

The problem is that the order of pmu_ctx_list for the parent is impacted by
the time when an event/PMU is added. While the order for a child is
impacted by the event order in the pinned_groups and flexible_groups. So
the order of pmu_ctx_list in the parent and child may be different.

To fix this problem, insert the perf_event_pmu_context to its proper place
after iteration of the pmu_ctx_list.

The follow testcase can trigger above warning:

 # perf record -e cycles --call-graph lbr -- taskset -c 3 ./a.out &
 # perf stat -e cpu-clock,cs -p xxx // xxx is the pid of a.out

 test.c

 void main() {
        int count = 0;
        pid_t pid;

        printf(""%d running\n"", getpid());
        sleep(30);
        printf(""running\n"");

        pid = fork();
        if (pid == -1) {
                printf(""fork error\n"");
                return;
        }
        if (pid == 0) {
                while (1) {
                        count++;
                }
        } else {
                while (1) {
                        count++;
                }
        }
 }

The testcase first opens an LBR event, so it will allocate task_ctx_data,
and then open tracepoint and software events, so the parent context will
have 3 different perf_event_pmu_contexts. On inheritance, child ctx will
insert the perf_event_pmu_context in another order and the warning will
trigger.

This happens due to the malformed report items sent by the emulated device
which results in a report, that has no fields, being added to the report list.
Due to this appleir_input_configured() is never called, hidinput_connect()
fails which results in the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag is not being set. However,
it  does not make appleir_probe() fail and lets the event callback to be
called without the associated input device.

Thus, add a check for the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag and leave the event hook
early if the driver didn't claim any input_dev for some reason. Moreover,
some other hid drivers accessing input_dev in their event callbacks do have
similar checks, too.

pfcp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns dismantle.

pfcp_newlink() links the device to a list in dev_net(dev) instead
of net, where a udp tunnel socket is created.

Even when net is removed, the device stays alive on dev_net(dev).
Then, removing net triggers the splat below. [0]

In this example, pfcp0 is created in ns2, but the udp socket is
created in ns1.

  ip netns add ns1
  ip netns add ns2
  ip -n ns1 link add netns ns2 name pfcp0 type pfcp
  ip netns del ns1

Let's link the device to the socket's netns instead.

Now, pfcp_net_exit() needs another netdev iteration to remove
all pfcp devices in the netns.

pfcp_dev_list is not used under RCU, so the list API is converted
to the non-RCU variant.

pfcp_net_exit() can be converted to .exit_batch_rtnl() in net-next.

CQE with an error on the UMR QP.

During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls
occurs:

mlx5_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait()

At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardware's perspective.

However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by
another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey.

This task will:
 - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock.
 - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP.
 - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error,
   causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1].

To resolve this race condition, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also
acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope.  Upon successful revoke,
we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any
further invalidation attempts on its lkey.

mm/zswap: fix inconsistency when zswap_store_page() fails

Commit b7c0ccdfbafd (""mm: zswap: support large folios in zswap_store()"")
skips charging any zswap entries when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

However, when some base pages are zswapped but it failed to zswap the
entire folio, the zswap operation is rolled back.  When freeing zswap
entries for those pages, zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries
that were not previously charged, causing zswap charging to become
inconsistent.

This inconsistency triggers two warnings with following steps:
  # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap
  $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 # wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng
  $ sudo reboot

  The two warnings are:
    in mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():
      WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes & (PAGE_SIZE - 1));

    in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():
      if (WARN_ONCE(new < 0, ""page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\n"",
	  new, nr_pages))

zswap_stored_pages also becomes inconsistent in the same way.

As suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages and charge zswap
entries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way,
zswap_entry_free() will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries
when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

While this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and
incrementing the counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and
leave the optimization for later after some evaluation.

After resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.

mm: abort vma_modify() on merge out of memory failure

The remainder of vma_modify() relies upon the vmg state remaining pristine
after a merge attempt.

Usually this is the case, however in the one edge case scenario of a merge
attempt failing not due to the specified range being unmergeable, but
rather due to an out of memory error arising when attempting to commit the
merge, this assumption becomes untrue.

This results in vmg->start, end being modified, and thus the proceeding
attempts to split the VMA will be done with invalid start/end values.

Thankfully, it is likely practically impossible for us to hit this in
reality, as it would require a maple tree node pre-allocation failure that
would likely never happen due to it being 'too small to fail', i.e.  the
kernel would simply keep retrying reclaim until it succeeded.

However, this scenario remains theoretically possible, and what we are
doing here is wrong so we must correct it.

The safest option is, when this scenario occurs, to simply give up the
operation.  If we cannot allocate memory to merge, then we cannot allocate
memory to split either (perhaps moreso!).

Any scenario where this would be happening would be under very extreme
(likely fatal) memory pressure, so it's best we give up early.

So there is no doubt it is appropriate to simply bail out in this
scenario.

However, in general we must if at all possible never assume VMG state is
stable after a merge attempt, since merge operations update VMG fields. 
As a result, additionally also make this clear by storing start, end in
local variables.

The issue was reported originally by syzkaller, and by Brad Spengler (via
an off-list discussion), and in both instances it manifested as a
triggering of the assert:

	VM_WARN_ON_VMG(start >= end, vmg);

In vma_merge_existing_range().

It seems at least one scenario in which this is occurring is one in which
the merge being attempted is due to an madvise() across multiple VMAs
which looks like this:

        start     end
          |<------>|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

When madvise_walk_vmas() is invoked, we first find vma in the above
(determining prev to be equal to vma as we are offset into vma), and then
enter the loop.

We determine the end of vma that forms part of the range we are
madvise()'ing by setting 'tmp' to this value:

		/* Here vma->vm_start <= start < (end|vma->vm_end) */
		tmp = vma->vm_end;

We then invoke the madvise() operation via visit(), letting prev get
updated to point to vma as part of the operation:

		/* Here vma->vm_start <= start < tmp <= (end|vma->vm_end). */
		error = visit(vma, &prev, start, tmp, arg);

Where the visit() function pointer in this instance is
madvise_vma_behavior().

As observed in syzkaller reports, it is ultimately madvise_update_vma()
that is invoked, calling vma_modify_flags_name() and vma_modify() in turn.

Then, in vma_modify(), we attempt the merge:

	merged = vma_merge_existing_range(vmg);
	if (merged)
		return merged;

We invoke this with vmg->start, end set to start, tmp as such:

        start  tmp
          |<--->|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

We find ourselves in the merge right scenario, but the one in which we
cannot remove the middle (we are offset into vma).

Here we have a special case where vmg->start, end get set to perhaps
unintuitive values - we intended to shrink the middle VMA and expand the
next.

This means vmg->start, end are set to...  vma->vm_start, start.

Now the commit_merge() fails, and vmg->start, end are left like this. 
This means we return to the rest of vma_modify() with vmg->start, end
(here denoted as start', end') set as:

  start' end'
     |<-->|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

So we now erroneously try to split accordingly.  This is where the

kernel: be more careful about dup_mmap() failures and uprobe registering

If a memory allocation fails during dup_mmap(), the maple tree can be left
in an unsafe state for other iterators besides the exit path.  All the
locks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the
incomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding
the vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.

Up to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an
mm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make
the incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been
proven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as
referenced in the link below.

Although 8ac662f5da19f (""fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to
invalid mm"") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the
race.

This patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the
oom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom
victim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential
users from using a partially initialised mm_struct.

When registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked
unstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm
isn't fully initialised.",

eth: bnxt: fix kernel panic in the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}

When qstats-get operation is executed, callbacks of netdev_stats_ops
are called. The bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx} collect per-queue stats
from sw_stats in the rings.
But {rx | tx | cp}_ring are allocated when the interface is up.
So, these rings are not allocated when the interface is down.

The qstats-get is allowed even if the interface is down. However,
the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}() accesses cp_ring and tx_ring
without null check.
So, it needs to avoid accessing rings if the interface is down.

Reproducer:
 ip link set $interface down
 ./cli.py --spec netdev.yaml --dump qstats-get
OR
 ip link set $interface down
 python ./stats.py

If migration succeeded, we called

Similarly, if migration failed, memcg_data of the dst folio is left unset.

add the folio to be freed to the LRU, making memcg code unhappy.  Running

sctp: sysctl: udp_port: avoid using current->nsproxy

As mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'
structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:

- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only
  from the opener's netns.

- current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'
  (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by
  syzbot [1] using acct(2).

The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using
container_of().

Note that table->data could also be used directly, but that would
increase the size of this fix, while 'sctp.ctl_sock' still needs to be
retrieved from 'net' structure.",

wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()

On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL
pointer dereference occurs.

The following sequence deletes the interface:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_remove_interface()
      brcmf_del_if()

Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to
BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.

After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is
called providing the following sequence:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_proto_detach()
      brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()

call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside
brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.

This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.

update the tx statistic, all other uses of the ifp pointer have been
guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL.",

net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one

A blocking notification chain uses a read-write semaphore to protect the
integrity of the chain. The semaphore is acquired for writing when
adding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading
when traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.

In case of the blocking switchdev notification chain, recursive
notifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired
twice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].

Specifically, this can happen when the bridge driver processes a
SWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications
about deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().

Fix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification
chain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect
the chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain.
Events are always informed under the RTNL mutex, but add an assertion in
call_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in
the future.

Maintain the ""blocking"" prefix as events are always emitted from process
context and listeners are allowed to block.

The system can experience a random crash a few minutes after the driver is

the ishtp_hid_remove() function.

The function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loop
that destroys the HID devices, which can lead to accessing freed memory.
Specifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls
`hid_ishtp_set_feature()` to power off the sensor, so freeing
`driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory.

net: mana: cleanup mana struct after debugfs_remove()

When on a MANA VM hibernation is triggered, as part of hibernate_snapshot(),
mana_gd_suspend() and mana_gd_resume() are called. If during this
mana_gd_resume(), a failure occurs with HWC creation, mana_port_debugfs
pointer does not get reinitialized and ends up pointing to older,
cleaned-up dentry.
Further in the hibernation path, as part of power_down(), mana_gd_shutdown()
is triggered. This call, unaware of the failures in resume, tries to cleanup
the already cleaned up  mana_port_debugfs value and hits the following bug:

2719,CVE-2025-21816,,,,,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hrtimers: Force migrate away hrtimers queued after CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING

hrtimers are migrated away from the dying CPU to any online target at
the CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING stage in order not to delay bandwidth timers
handling tasks involved in the CPU hotplug forward progress.

However wakeups can still be performed by the outgoing CPU after
CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING. Those can result again in bandwidth timers being
armed. Depending on several considerations (crystal ball power management
based election, earliest timer already enqueued, timer migration enabled or
not), the target may eventually be the current CPU even if offline. If that
happens, the timer is eventually ignored.

The most notable example is RCU which had to deal with each and every of
those wake-ups by deferring them to an online CPU, along with related
workarounds:

_ e787644caf76 (rcu: Defer RCU kthreads wakeup when CPU is dying)
_ 9139f93209d1 (rcu/nocb: Fix RT throttling hrtimer armed from offline CPU)
_ f7345ccc62a4 (rcu/nocb: Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirq)

The problem isn't confined to RCU though as the stop machine kthread
(which runs CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING) reports its completion at the end
of its work through cpu_stop_signal_done() and performs a wake up that
eventually arms the deadline server timer:

Instead of providing yet another bandaid to work around the situation, fix
it in the hrtimers infrastructure instead: always migrate away a timer to
an online target whenever it is enqueued from an offline CPU.

This will also allow to revert all the above RCU disgraceful hacks.",

sched/fair: Fix potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list

child_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a 'prev' pointer to a cfs_rq.
This 'prev' pointer can originate from struct rq's leaf_cfs_rq_list,
making the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory
corruption. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and
the task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory
fault or access garbage data.

The issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both
cfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same
leaf list. Also, rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.

This adds a check `if (prev == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main
conditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of
operation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.

This check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added
to the list, so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list
head is enough.

Fixes a potential memory corruption issue that due to current struct
layout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable

nilfs2: do not force clear folio if buffer is referenced

Patch series ""nilfs2: protect busy buffer heads from being force-cleared"".

This series fixes the buffer head state inconsistency issues reported by
syzbot that occurs when the filesystem is corrupted and falls back to
read-only, and the associated buffer head use-after-free issue.


This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported that after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and
falls back to read-only, inconsistencies in the buffer state may occur.

One of the inconsistencies is that when nilfs2 calls mark_buffer_dirty()
to set a data or metadata buffer as dirty, but it detects that the buffer
is not in the uptodate state:

drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence

In commit e4b5ccd392b9 (""drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL
after job completion""), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer
to NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM
scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is
signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.
This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the
job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns
a new job to the pointer.

This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ
execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns
it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an
interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

f8 corresponds to KASAN_VMALLOC_INVALID which means the area is not
initialised hence not supposed to be used yet.

Powerpc text patching infrastructure allocates a virtual memory area
using get_vm_area() and flags it as VM_ALLOC. But that flag is meant
to be used for vmalloc() and vmalloc() allocated memory is not
supposed to be used before a call to __vmalloc_node_range() which is
never called for that area.

That went undetected until commit e4137f08816b (""mm, kasan, kmsan:
instrument copy_from/to_kernel_nofault"")

The area allocated by text_area_cpu_up() is not vmalloc memory, it is
mapped directly on demand when needed by map_kernel_page(). There is
no VM flag corresponding to such usage, so just pass no flag. That way
the area will be unpoisonned and usable immediately.",

suspended if the port is not power manageable by the platform and won't be

Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for usb_driver_claim_interface()

The documentation for usb_driver_claim_interface() says that ""the
device lock"" is needed when the function is called from places other
than probe(). This appears to be the lock for the USB interface
device. The Mediatek btusb code gets called via this path:

  Workqueue: hci0 hci_power_on [bluetooth]

With the above call trace the device lock hasn't been claimed. Claim
it.

Without this fix, we'd sometimes see the error ""Failed to claim iso
interface"". Sometimes we'd even see worse errors, like a NULL pointer
dereference (where `intf->dev.driver` was NULL) with a trace like:

reveliofuzzing reported that a SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with out_len

ATA_NOP, and protocol set to ATA_PROT_PIO, can cause ata_pio_sector() to

to be a bug either in libata-sff or QEMU, where either this status is not
set, or the status is cleared before read by ata_sff_hsm_move().
Anyway, that is most likely a separate bug.

Looking at __atapi_pio_bytes(), it already has a safety check to ensure
that __atapi_pio_bytes() cannot write outside the allocated buffer.

This happens because we have another success path for the zoned mode. When
there is no active zone available, btrfs_reserve_extent() returns
-EAGAIN. In this case, we have two reactions.

(1) If the given range is never allocated, we can only wait for someone
    to finish a zone, so wait on BTRFS_FS_NEED_ZONE_FINISH bit and retry
    afterward.

(2) Or, if some allocations are already done, we must bail out and let
    the caller to send IOs for the allocation. This is because these IOs
    may be necessary to finish a zone.

The commit 06f364284794 (""btrfs: do proper folio cleanup when
cow_file_range() failed"") moved the unlock code from the inside of the
loop to the outside. So, previously, the allocated extents are unlocked
just after the allocation and so before returning from the function.
However, they are no longer unlocked on the case (2) above. That caused
the hang issue.

Fix the issue by modifying the 'end' to the end of the allocated
range. Then, we can exit the loop and the same unlock code can properly

block: fix queue freeze vs limits lock order in sysfs store methods

queue_attr_store() always freezes a device queue before calling the
attribute store operation. For attributes that control queue limits, the
store operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to
queue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may
need to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the
hardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA
deadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing
the device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the
device queue limits.

Avoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the
->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the
queue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking
the limits lock.

This also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as
it doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.
Hopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.

cdx: Fix possible UAF error in driver_override_show()

Fixed a possible UAF problem in driver_override_show() in drivers/cdx/cdx.c

This function driver_override_show() is part of DEVICE_ATTR_RW, which
includes both driver_override_show() and driver_override_store().
These functions can be executed concurrently in sysfs.

The driver_override_store() function uses driver_set_override() to
update the driver_override value, and driver_set_override() internally
locks the device (device_lock(dev)). If driver_override_show() reads
cdx_dev->driver_override without locking, it could potentially access
a freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string
concurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address, which is a
security risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.

Additionally, a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c, as well
as many other bus drivers, where device_lock() is taken in the show
function, and it has been working without issues.

This potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis
tool, which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify

2824,CVE-2025-21702,,,,,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch->limit == 0

Expected behaviour:
In case we reach scheduler's limit, pfifo_tail_enqueue() will drop a
packet in scheduler's queue and decrease scheduler's qlen by one.
Then, pfifo_tail_enqueue() enqueue new packet and increase
scheduler's qlen by one. Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return
`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

Weird behaviour:
In case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a
scheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.
This means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.
Then, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by
one. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by
one and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

The problem is:
Let's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.
 - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.
   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch->limit == 0`.
 - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.

Enqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:
 - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -> pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)
 - Qdisc_B->q.qlen += 1
 - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`
 - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` => hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.

The whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A->q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B->q.qlen == 1.
Replace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.
This violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.

sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts

Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot
still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow
counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.

To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,
this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters
to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any
increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving
readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into
these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the
code (which was the cause of the original logic error).

As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated
into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the
ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a
sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect
of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow
stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should
not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth
complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.",

drm/xe/hmm: Don't dereference struct page pointers without notifier lock

The pnfs that we obtain from hmm_range_fault() point to pages that
we don't have a reference on, and the guarantee that they are still
in the cpu page-tables is that the notifier lock must be held and the
notifier seqno is still valid.

So while building the sg table and marking the pages accesses / dirty
we need to hold this lock with a validated seqno.

However, the lock is reclaim tainted which makes
sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment() unusable, since it internally
allocates memory.

Instead build the sg-table manually. For the non-iommu case
this might lead to fewer coalesces, but if that's a problem it can
be fixed up later in the resource cursor code. For the iommu case,
the whole sg-table may still be coalesced to a single contigous
device va region.

This avoids marking pages that we don't own dirty and accessed, and
it also avoid dereferencing struct pages that we don't own.

- Use assert to check whether hmm pfns are valid (Matthew Auld)
- Take into account that large pages may cross range boundaries

This problem seems particularly prevalent if the user advertises an
endpoint that has a different external vs internal address.  In the case
where the external address is advertised and multiple connections
already exist, multiple subflow SYNs arrive in parallel which tends to
trigger the race during creation of the first local_addr_list entries
which have the internal address instead.

Fix by skipping the replacement of an existing implicit local address if
called via mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id.",
2847,CVE-2025-21892,,,,,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix the recovery flow of the UMR QP

This patch addresses an issue in the recovery flow of the UMR QP,
ensuring tasks do not get stuck, as highlighted by the call trace [1].

During recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the
software must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete.

Failing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed
CQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB
specification.

This race condition can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.

To resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a
barrier before moving the QP state to RESET.

Once a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no
outstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and
subsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality.

Note:
For the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR.
Since the QP is in an error state, it will only receive
IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we don't
care about its status.

2874,CVE-2025-21754,,,,,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix assertion failure when splitting ordered extent after transaction abort

If while we are doing a direct IO write a transaction abort happens, we
mark all existing ordered extents with the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag (done
at btrfs_destroy_ordered_extents()), and then after that if we enter
btrfs_split_ordered_extent() and the ordered extent has bytes left
(meaning we have a bio that doesn't cover the whole ordered extent, see
details at btrfs_extract_ordered_extent()), we will fail on the following
assertion at btrfs_split_ordered_extent():

   ASSERT(!(flags & ~BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS));

because the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag is set and the definition of
BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS is just the union of all flags that identify the
type of write (regular, nocow, prealloc, compressed, direct IO, encoded).

Fix this by returning an error from btrfs_extract_ordered_extent() if we
find the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag in the ordered extent. The error will
be the error that resulted in the transaction abort or -EIO if no
transaction abort happened.

driver core: class: Fix wild pointer dereferences in API class_dev_iter_next()

There are a potential wild pointer dereferences issue regarding APIs
class_dev_iter_(init|next|exit)(), as explained by below typical usage:

// All members of @iter are wild pointers.
struct class_dev_iter iter;

// class_dev_iter_init(@iter, @class, ...) checks parameter @class for
// potential class_to_subsys() error, and it returns void type and does
// not initialize its output parameter @iter, so caller can not detect
// the error and continues to invoke class_dev_iter_next(@iter) even if
// @iter still contains wild pointers.

// Dereference these wild pointers in @iter here once suffer the error.
while (dev = class_dev_iter_next(&iter)) { ... };

// Also dereference these wild pointers here.

Actually, all callers of these APIs have such usage pattern in kernel tree.

acpi: typec: ucsi: Introduce a ->poll_cci method

For the ACPI backend of UCSI the UCSI ""registers"" are just a memory copy
of the register values in an opregion. The ACPI implementation in the
BIOS ensures that the opregion contents are synced to the embedded
controller and it ensures that the registers (in particular CCI) are
synced back to the opregion on notifications. While there is an ACPI call
that syncs the actual registers to the opregion there is rarely a need to
do this and on some ACPI implementations it actually breaks in various
interesting ways.

The only reason to force a sync from the embedded controller is to poll
CCI while notifications are disabled. Only the ucsi core knows if this
is the case and guessing based on the current command is suboptimal, i.e.
leading to the following spurious assertion splat:

The reason was that the code that maps the ring buffer pages to user space
has:

	page = virt_to_page((void *)cpu_buffer->subbuf_ids[s]);

And uses that in:

	vm_insert_pages(vma, vma->vm_start, pages, &nr_pages);

But virt_to_page() does not work with vmap()'d memory which is what the
persistent ring buffer has. It is rather trivial to allow this, but for
now just disable mmap() of instances that have their ring buffer from the
reserve_mem option.

If an mmap() is performed on a persistent buffer it will return -ENODEV

gpio: aggregator: protect driver attr handlers against module unload

Both new_device_store and delete_device_store touch module global
resources (e.g. gpio_aggregator_lock). To prevent race conditions with
module unload, a reference needs to be held.

Add try_module_get() in these handlers.

For new_device_store, this eliminates what appears to be the most dangerous
scenario: if an id is allocated from gpio_aggregator_idr but
platform_device_register has not yet been called or completed, a concurrent
module unload could fail to unregister/delete the device, leaving behind a
dangling platform device/GPIO forwarder. This can result in various issues.
The following simple reproducer demonstrates these problems:

  #!/bin/bash
  while :; do
    # note: whether 'gpiochip0 0' exists or not does not matter.
    echo 'gpiochip0 0' > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/gpio-aggregator/new_device

This is because when the napi's weight is set to 0, process_backlog() may
return 0 and clear the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit of napi->state, causing this
napi to be re-polled in net_rx_action() until __do_softirq() times out.
Since the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit has been cleared, napi_schedule_rps() can
be retriggered in enqueue_to_backlog(), causing this issue.

Making the napi's weight always non-zero solves this problem.

scsi: ufs: core: Fix use-after free in init error and remove paths

devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() registers a cleanup handler to run when
the associated (platform-) device is being released. For UFS, the
crypto private data and pointers are stored as part of the ufs_hba's
data structure 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This structure is
allocated as part of the underlying ufshcd and therefore Scsi_host
allocation.

During driver release or during error handling in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(),
this structure is released as part of ufshcd_dealloc_host() before the
(platform-) device associated with the crypto call above is released.
Once this device is released, the crypto cleanup code will run, using
the just-released 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This causes a
use-after-free situation:

  Call trace:

In other words, the initialisation code flow is:

  platform-device probe
    ufshcd_pltfrm_init()
      ufshcd_alloc_host()
        scsi_host_alloc()
          allocation of struct ufs_hba
          creation of scsi-host devices
    devm_blk_crypto_profile_init()
      devm registration of cleanup handler using platform-device

and during error handling of ufshcd_pltfrm_init() or during driver
removal:

  ufshcd_dealloc_host()
    scsi_host_put()
      put_device(scsi-host)
        release of struct ufs_hba
  put_device(platform-device)
    crypto cleanup handler

To fix this use-after free, change ufshcd_alloc_host() to register a
devres action to automatically cleanup the underlying SCSI device on
ufshcd destruction, without requiring explicit calls to
ufshcd_dealloc_host(). This way:

    * the crypto profile and all other ufs_hba-owned resources are
      destroyed before SCSI (as they've been registered after)
    * a memleak is plugged in tc-dwc-g210-pci.c remove() as a
      side-effect
    * EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ufshcd_dealloc_host) can be removed fully as
      it's not needed anymore
    * no future drivers using ufshcd_alloc_host() could ever forget
      adding the cleanup",CWE-416
2903,CVE-2025-21693,7.8,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug

In zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the
current CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used
throughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,
it is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.

If the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,
we run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx
are freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. 
acomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).

The problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (""mm/zswap: move to use
crypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration"") when the switch to the
crypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was
retrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the
CPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the
crypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.

Use the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating
and freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure
that acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the
compression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after
acquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new
CPU.

The initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug
callback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is
allocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU
hotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by
compression/decompression.

Previously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This
would have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already
holding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a
deadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but
Johannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug
notifiers [2].

Alternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:
- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in
  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in
  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the
  CPU is onlined.
- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but
  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could
  result in subtle performance issues.

OP-TEE supplicant is a user-space daemon and it's possible for it

ordering of the supplicant process vs the OP-TEE client application which
can eventually lead to system hang-up waiting for the closure of the

Allow the client process waiting in kernel for supplicant response to
be killed rather than indefinitely waiting in an unkillable state. Also,
a normal uninterruptible wait should not have resulted in the hung-task
watchdog getting triggered, but the endless loop would.

This fixes issues observed during system reboot/shutdown when supplicant
got hung for some reason or gets crashed/killed which lead to client

ppp: Fix KMSAN uninit-value warning with bpf

Syzbot caught an ""KMSAN: uninit-value"" warning [1], which is caused by the
ppp driver not initializing a 2-byte header when using socket filter.

The following code can generate a PPP filter BPF program:
'''
struct bpf_program fp;
pcap_t *handle;
handle = pcap_open_dead(DLT_PPP_PPPD, 65535);
pcap_compile(handle, &fp, ""ip and outbound"", 0, 0);
bpf_dump(&fp, 1);
'''
Its output is:
'''
(000) ldh [2]
(001) jeq #0x21 jt 2 jf 5
(002) ldb [0]
(003) jeq #0x1 jt 4 jf 5
(004) ret #65535
(005) ret #0
'''
Wen can find similar code at the following link:
https://github.com/ppp-project/ppp/blob/master/pppd/options.c#L1680
The maintainer of this code repository is also the original maintainer
of the ppp driver.

As you can see the BPF program skips 2 bytes of data and then reads the
'Protocol' field to determine if it's an IP packet. Then it read the first
byte of the first 2 bytes to determine the direction.

The issue is that only the first byte indicating direction is initialized
in current ppp driver code while the second byte is not initialized.

For normal BPF programs generated by libpcap, uninitialized data won't be
used, so it's not a problem. However, for carefully crafted BPF programs,
such as those generated by syzkaller [2], which start reading from offset
0, the uninitialized data will be used and caught by KMSAN.

RDMA/mlx5: Fix a WARN during dereg_mr for DM type

Memory regions (MR) of type DM (device memory) do not have an associated
umem.

In the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() -> mlx5_free_priv_descs() flow, the code
incorrectly takes the wrong branch, attempting to call
dma_unmap_single() on a DMA address that is not mapped.

This results in a WARN [1], as shown below.

The issue is resolved by properly accounting for the DM type and
ensuring the correct branch is selected in mlx5_free_priv_descs().

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       ""%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n"",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_ports
indicating it is out-of-bounds.",

netfilter: nf_conncount: Fully initialize struct nf_conncount_tuple in insert_tree()

Since commit b36e4523d4d5 (""netfilter: nf_conncount: fix garbage
collection confirm race""), `cpu` and `jiffies32` were introduced to
the struct nf_conncount_tuple.

The commit made nf_conncount_add() initialize `conn->cpu` and
`conn->jiffies32` when allocating the struct.
In contrast, count_tree() was not changed to initialize them.

By commit 34848d5c896e (""netfilter: nf_conncount: Split insert and
traversal""), count_tree() was split and the relevant allocation
code now resides in insert_tree().
Initialize `conn->cpu` and `conn->jiffies32` in insert_tree().

3740,CVE-2025-24888,8.1,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH,freedomofpress,"The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to version 0.14.1, a malicious SecureDrop Server could obtain code execution on the SecureDrop Client virtual machine (`sd-app`). SecureDrop Server itself has multiple layers of built-in hardening, and is a dedicated physical machine exposed on the internet only via Tor hidden services for the Source and Journalist interfaces, and optionally via remote SSH access over another Tor hidden service. A newsroom's SecureDrop Workstation communicates only with its own dedicated SecureDrop Server.

The SecureDrop Client runs in a dedicated Qubes virtual machine, named `sd-app`, as part of the SecureDrop Workstation. The private OpenPGP key used to decrypt submissions and replies is stored in a separate virtual machine and never accessed directly. The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for downloading replies. The filename of the reply is obtained from the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header and used to write the encrypted reply on disk. Note that filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, and files are downloaded in an encrypted format, so a remote attacker who has not achieved server compromise, such as one posing as a source, could not craft the HTTP response necessary for this attack.

While the filename is later checked to guard against path traversal before being moved into the Client’s data storage directory, the file has already been written to a potentially arbitrary location. In this case, `safe_move()` would detect the path traversal and fail, leaving the original downloaded file in the attacker-chosen directory. Code execution can be gained by writing an autostart file in `/home/user/.config/autostart/`.

Version 0.14.1 fixes the issue. As of time of publication, there is no known evidence of exploitation in the wild. This attack requires a previously compromised SecureDrop Server.",CWE-22

If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force. This occurs because the records and counting process for this system uses the method utilized for sign in rather than the effective username attribute. This has a minimal impact on account security, this impact is increased naturally in scenarios when there is no two-factor authentication required and weak passwords are used. This makes it a bit easier to brute-force a password. A patch for this issue has been applied to versions 4.38.19, and 4.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should 1.

3847,CVE-2025-24889,4.5,MEDIUM,LOW,LOW,freedomofpress,"The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1, an attacker who has already gained code execution in a virtual machine on the SecureDrop Workstation could gain code execution in the `sd-log` virtual machine by sending a specially crafted log entry. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires an attacker to already have code execution on one of the other virtual machines (VMs) of the system. Due to the Workstation's underlying usage of Qubes for strong isolation, the vulnerability would have allowed lateral movement between any log-enabled VM and the `sd-log` VM, but no further. The SecureDrop workstation collects logs centrally in an isolated virtual machine named `sd-log` for easy export for support and debugging purposes. The `sd-log`  VM is completely isolated from the internet and ingests logs via a narrow Qubes RPC policy that allows for specific inter-VM communication via the Xen vchan protocol used by Qubes's qrexec mechanism. A path traversal bug was found in the logic used to choose where to write the log file for a specific VM: the VM name, used unsanitized in the destination path in `sd-log`, is supplied by the logging VM itself instead of being read from a trusted source, such as the Qubes environment variable `QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN` that is used in the fixed implementation. An attacker could provide an arbitrary source VM name, possibly overwriting logs of other VMs, or writing a file named `syslog.log`, with attacker-controlled content, in arbitrary directories as a low-privileged user. A successful attack could potentially overwrite or add configuration to software that loads configuration files from a directory. This is exploitable to achieve code execution by setting the target directory to `/home/user/.config/autostart/` and letting it write `syslog.log`, because XFCE treats any file in that directory as a `.desktop` file regardless of its extension.

3984,CVE-2025-24362,,,,,github,"In some circumstances, debug artifacts uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow run may contain the environment variables from the workflow run, including any secrets that were exposed as environment variables to the workflow. Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.

For some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.

Environment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:
- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.
- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.
- Running with debug artifacts enabled.
- Using CodeQL Action versions <= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and <= 2.20.2.
- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.
- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:
- Using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3.
- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).

In rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.

In CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 and <= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. 

On Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.
The intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.

Therefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.

The impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:
- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.
- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository.",CWE-532

Service Provider (SP): the system that provides a service to the user and relies on the Identity Provider to authenticate the user, receives SAML assertions from the IdP to grant access to resources. The library cie-aspnetcore refers to the second entity, the SP, and implements the validation logic of SAML assertions within SAML responses. In affected versions there is no guarantee that the first signature refers to the root object, it follows that if an attacker injects an item signed as the first element, all other signatures will not be verified.

The policy group feature, added to by the 1.17.0 release. By being namespaced, the AdmissionPolicyGroup has a well constrained impact on cluster resources. Hence, it’s considered safe to allow non-admin users to create and manage these resources in the namespaces they own. Kubewarden policies can be allowed to query the Kubernetes API at evaluation time; these types of policies are called “context aware“. Context aware policies can perform list and get operations against a Kubernetes cluster. The queries are done using the ServiceAccount of the Policy Server instance that hosts the policy. That means that access to the cluster is determined by the RBAC rules that apply to that ServiceAccount. The AdmissionPolicyGroup CRD allowed the deployment of context aware policies.

The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK) verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `remuneracao.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `descricao` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `remuneracao.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6.

A Security vulnerability has been found starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to 1.10.3 and 1.11.3 on several director endpoints of REST API. To reproduce this vulnerability an authenticated user with permission to access the Director is required (plus api access with regard to the api endpoints). And even though some of these Icinga Director users are restricted from accessing certain objects, are able to retrieve information related to them if their name is known. This makes it possible to change the configuration of these objects by those Icinga Director users restricted from accessing them. This results in further exploitation, data breaches and sensitive information disclosure. Affected endpoints include icingaweb2/director/service, if the host name is left out of the query; icingaweb2/directore/notification; icingaweb2/director/serviceset; and icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime. In addition, the endpoint `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` returns a status code 200 even though the services for the host is filtered. This in turn lets the restricted user know that the host `filteredHostName` exists even though the user is restricted from accessing it.  This could again result in further exploitation of this information and data breaches. Icinga Director has patches in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.1.

An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host.

However, the current `tls.connect` method will always set `rejectUnauthorized: false` which is a potential security concern. CDK should follow the best practice and set `rejectUnauthorized: true`. However, this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and we should fix this with a feature flag. Note that this is marked as low severity Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider, CDK should not disallow this. Additionally, the code block is run in a Lambda environment which mitigate the MITM attack. The patch is in progress. To mitigate, upgrade to CDK v2.177.0 (Expected release date 2025-02-22).

In affected versions if there are two overlapping policies for the `update` action that allow access to different fields, instead of correctly checking access permissions against the item they apply for the user is allowed to update the superset of fields allowed by any of the policies. E.g. have one policy allowing update access to `field_a` if the `id == 1` and one policy allowing update access to `field_b` if the `id == 2`. The user with both these policies is allowed to update both `field_a` and `field_b` for the items with ids `1` and `2`. Before v11, if a user was allowed to update an item they were allowed to update the fields that the single permission, that applied to that item, listed. With overlapping permissions this isn't as clear cut anymore and the union of fields might not be the fields the user is allowed to update for that specific item. The solution that this PR introduces is to evaluate the permissions for each field that the user tries to update in the validateItemAccess DB query, instead of only verifying access to the item as a whole. This is done by, instead of returning the actual field value, returning a flag that indicates if the user has access to that field. This uses the same case/when mechanism that is used for stripping out non permitted field that is at the core of the permissions engine. As a result, for every item that the access is validated for, the expected result is an item that has either 1 or null for all the ""requested"" fields instead of any of the actual field values. These results are not useful for anything other than verifying the field level access permissions. The final check in validateItemAccess can either fail if the number of items does not match the number of items the access is checked for (ie. the user does not have access to the item at all) or if not all of the passed in fields have access permissions for any of the returned items. This is a vulnerability that allows update access to unintended fields, potentially impacting the password field for user accounts.

Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket.

5232,CVE-2025-27636,,,,,Apache Software Foundation,"Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel components under particular conditions.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through <= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.



This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific

headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method

on the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a malicious header can be used to send

the message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application. This could also be seen by using the camel-exec component




The attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are

directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests

that are send to the Camel application.




All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

In these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.

In terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: 


  *  camel-activemq
  *  camel-activemq6
  *  camel-amqp
  *  camel-aws2-sqs
  *  camel-azure-servicebus
  *  camel-cxf-rest
  *  camel-cxf-soap
  *  camel-http
  *  camel-jetty
  *  camel-jms
  *  camel-kafka
  *  camel-knative
  *  camel-mail
  *  camel-nats
  *  camel-netty-http
  *  camel-platform-http
  *  camel-rest
  *  camel-sjms
  *  camel-spring-rabbitmq
  *  camel-stomp
  *  camel-tahu
  *  camel-undertow
  *  camel-xmpp






The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"", or ""org.apache.camel."". 


Mitigation: You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like ""cAmel, cAMEL"" etc, or in general everything not starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"" or ""org.apache.camel."".",

5293,CVE-2025-27148,8.8,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH,gradle,"Gradle is a build automation tool, and its native-platform tool provides Java bindings for native APIs. On Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. This library initialization could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. Gradle builds that rely on versions of net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to 0.22-milestone-28 could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.

In net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to version 0.22-milestone-28, if the `Native.get(Class<>)` method was called, without calling `Native.init(File)` first, with a non-`null` argument used as working file path, then the library would initialize itself using the system temporary directory and NativeLibraryLocator.java lines 68 through 78. Version 0.22-milestone-28 has been released with changes that fix the problem. Initialization is now mandatory and no longer uses the system temporary directory, unless such a path is passed for initialization. The only workaround for affected versions is to make sure to do a proper initialization, using a location that is safe.

Gradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit. Users of Windows or modern versions of macOS are not vulnerable, nor are users of a Unix-like operating system with the ""sticky"" bit set or `noexec` on their system temporary directory vulnerable. This problem was fixed in Gradle 8.12.1. Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug. Some workarounds are available. On Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the ""sticky"" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting. Those who are are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir.

While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times.

RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the client's key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups).

Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted by a vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.3.2. Both Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratify’s Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry. As of versions 1.2.3 and 1.3.2, the Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange.

When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from external networks. The server will include the responses from these internal requests in the resulting bucket configuration, effectively leaking sensitive information. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LocalS3 service to exploit this vulnerability.",CWE-611

5655,CVE-2025-26620,,,,,DuendeSoftware,"Duende.AccessTokenManagement is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens. Duende.AccessTokenManagement contains a race condition when requesting access tokens using the client credentials flow. Concurrent requests to obtain an access token using differing protocol parameters can return access tokens obtained with the wrong scope, resource indicator, or other protocol parameters. Such usage is somewhat atypical, and only a small percentage of users are likely to be affected. Duende.AccessTokenManagement can request access tokens using the client credentials flow in several ways. In basic usage, the client credentials flow is configured once and the parameters do not vary. In more advanced situations, requests with varying protocol parameters may be made by calling specific overloads of these methods: `HttpContext.GetClientAccessTokenAsync()` and `IClientCredentialsTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync()`. There are overloads of both of these methods that accept a `TokenRequestParameters` object that customizes token request parameters. However, concurrent requests with varying `TokenRequestParameters` will result in the same token for all concurrent calls. Most users can simply update the NuGet package to the latest version. Customizations of the `IClientCredentialsTokenCache` that derive from the default implementation (`DistributedClientCredentialsTokenCache`) will require a small code change, as its constructor was changed to add a dependency on the `ITokenRequestSynchronization` service. The synchronization service will need to be injected into the derived class and passed to the base constructor. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how Duende.AccessTokenManagement is used and on the security architecture of the solution. Most users will not be vulnerable to this issue. More advanced users may run into this issue by calling the methods specified above with customized token request parameters. The impact of obtaining an access token with different than intended protocol parameters will vary depending on application logic, security architecture, and the authorization policy of the resource servers.",CWE-367

This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.",CWE-367

6166,CVE-2025-32012,,,,,jellyfin,"Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. In versions 10.9.0 to before 10.10.7, the /System/Restart endpoint provides administrators the ability to restart their Jellyfin server. This endpoint is intended to be admins-only, but it also authorizes requests from any device in the same local network as the Jellyfin server. Due to the method Jellyfin uses to determine the source IP of a request, an unauthenticated attacker is able to spoof their IP to appear as a LAN IP, allowing them to restart the Jellyfin server process without authentication. This means that an unauthenticated attacker could mount a denial-of-service attack on any default-configured Jellyfin server by simply sending the same spoofed request every few seconds to restart the server over and over. This method of IP spoofing also bypasses some security mechanisms, cause a denial-of-service attack, and possible bypass the admin restart requirement if combined with remote code execution.

KVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state

There are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the host's
FPSIMD/SVE state, including:

* Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent
  configuration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to
  result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by
  Eric Auger:

  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997

* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an
  unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.

* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,
  where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses
  FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR
  before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale
  value in memory.

Avoid these by eagerly saving and ""flushing"" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME
state when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the
host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is
removed and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is
placed in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr'
should not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be
removed in subsequent patches.

Historical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous
assumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:

  8383741ab2e773a9 (""KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving"")

... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL
stable trees.",

usb: xhci: Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints

Two clearly different specimens of NEC uPD720200 (one with start/stop
bug, one without) were seen to cause IOMMU faults after some Missed
Service Errors. Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring
segment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was
received when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:

[ 1.041954] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0
[ 1.042120] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09000 flags=0x0000]
[ 1.042146] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000]

It gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to
the HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a
zero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in
page at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.

[ 7.098379] xhci_hcd: Overrun event on slot 1 ep 2

It's possible that data from the isochronous device were written to
random buffers of pending TDs on other endpoints (either IN or OUT),
other devices or even other HCs in the same IOMMU domain.

Lastly, an error from a different USB device on another HC. Was it
caused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk
was working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to
starve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs
shared one x1 slot by means of a commercial ""PCIe splitter"" board.

[ 7.162604] usb 10-2: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd

[ 7.179004] I/O error, dev sdb, sector 67284480 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 5 prio class 0

Fortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting
the chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are
known which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if
it's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.

The bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports
tens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining
Link TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.

usb: xhci: Don't skip on Stopped - Length Invalid

Up until commit d56b0b2ab142 (""usb: xhci: ensure skipped isoc TDs are
returned when isoc ring is stopped"") in v6.11, the driver didn't skip
missed isochronous TDs when handling Stoppend and Stopped - Length
Invalid events. Instead, it erroneously cleared the skip flag, which
would cause the ring to get stuck, as future events won't match the
missed TD which is never removed from the queue until it's cancelled.

This buggy logic seems to have been in place substantially unchanged
since the 3.x series over 10 years ago, which probably speaks first
and foremost about relative rarity of this case in normal usage, but
by the spec I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible.

After d56b0b2ab142, TDs are immediately skipped when handling those
Stopped events. This poses a potential problem in case of Stopped -
Length Invalid, which occurs either on completed TDs (likely already
given back) or Link and No-Op TRBs. Such event won't be recognized
as matching any TD (unless it's the rare Link TRB inside a TD) and
will result in skipping all pending TDs, giving them back possibly
before they are done, risking isoc data loss and maybe UAF by HW.

As a compromise, don't skip and don't clear the skip flag on this
kind of event. Then the next event will skip missed TDs. A downside
of not handling Stopped - Length Invalid on a Link inside a TD is
that if the TD is cancelled, its actual length will not be updated
to account for TRBs (silently) completed before the TD was stopped.

I had no luck producing this sequence of completion events so there
is no compelling demonstration of any resulting disaster. It may be
a very rare, obscure condition. The sole motivation for this patch
is that if such unlikely event does occur, I'd rather risk reporting
a cancelled partially done isoc frame as empty than gamble with UAF.

This will be fixed more properly by looking at Stopped event's TRB
pointer when making skipping decisions, but such rework is unlikely
to be backported to v6.12, which will stay around for a few years.",

can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source

Commit 7fdaf8966aae (""can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()"")
unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s
source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant
to be a more secure alternative :)).

Let's consider below buffers:

  dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */
  src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */

When doing:

  strncpy(dest, src, len);
  dest[len] = '\0';

strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.

On the other hand:

  strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);

will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound
read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note
that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to
read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.

This exact pattern happened in ucan.

The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of
doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as
usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable
can be removed.

On top of this do a couple refactors:

  - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so
    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to
    char.

  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware
    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it
    directly handle all the string termination logic.",

mm/migrate: fix shmem xarray update during migration

A shmem folio can be either in page cache or in swap cache, but not at the
same time.  Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio->mapping should be
NULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping.

In __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to
update, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that conflates shmem in page
cache case and shmem in swap cache case.  It leads to xarray multi-index
entry corruption, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during
xas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction).  Fix it by only using
folio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache
entries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update.

Note:
In __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() && folio_test_swapcache() is
used to get swap_cache address space, but that ignores the shmem folio in
swap cache case.  It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a
in-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since
!folio_test_anon() is true and folio->mapping is NULL.  But fortunately,
its caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY

Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources. 

An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources. 

This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.

6950,CVE-2025-22021,,,,,Linux,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: socket: Lookup orig tuple for IPv6 SNAT

nf_sk_lookup_slow_v4 does the conntrack lookup for IPv4 packets to
restore the original 5-tuple in case of SNAT, to be able to find the
right socket (if any). Then socket_match() can correctly check whether
the socket was transparent.

However, the IPv6 counterpart (nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6) lacks this
conntrack lookup, making xt_socket fail to match on the socket when the
packet was SNATed. Add the same logic to nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6.

IPv6 SNAT is used in Kubernetes clusters for pod-to-world packets, as
pods' addresses are in the fd00::/8 ULA subnet and need to be replaced
with the node's external address. Cilium leverages Envoy to enforce L7
policies, and Envoy uses transparent sockets. Cilium inserts an iptables
prerouting rule that matches on `-m socket --transparent` and redirects
the packets to localhost, but it fails to match SNATed IPv6 packets due
to that missing conntrack lookup.",

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.2, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.5, from 3.10.0 before 3.22.4.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.

This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, or the camel-exec component.

If you have Camel applications that are directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include parameters in the HTTP requests that are sent to the Camel application that get translated into headers. 

The headers could be both provided as request parameters for an HTTP methods invocation or as part of the payload of the HTTP methods invocation.

All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

This CVE is related to the CVE-2025-27636: while they have the same root cause and are fixed with the same fix, CVE-2025-27636 was assumed to only be exploitable if an attacker could add malicious HTTP headers, while we have now determined that it is also exploitable via HTTP parameters.

7361,CVE-2025-29786,7.5,HIGH,NONE,NONE,expr-lang,"Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isn’t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch.",CWE-770

7416,CVE-2025-29779,,,,,DavidOsipov,"Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `secure_redundant_execution` function in feldman_vss.py attempts to mitigate fault injection attacks by executing a function multiple times and comparing results. However, several critical weaknesses exist. Python's execution environment cannot guarantee true isolation between redundant executions, the constant-time comparison implementation in Python is subject to timing variations, the randomized execution order and timing provide insufficient protection against sophisticated fault attacks, and the error handling may leak timing information about partial execution results. These limitations make the protection ineffective against targeted fault injection attacks, especially from attackers with physical access to the hardware. A successful fault injection attack could allow an attacker to bypass the redundancy check mechanisms, extract secret polynomial coefficients during share generation or verification, force the acceptance of invalid shares during verification, and/or manipulate the commitment verification process to accept fraudulent commitments. This undermines the core security guarantees of the Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. Long-term remediation requires reimplementing the security-critical functions in a lower-level language like Rust. Short-term mitigations include deploying the software in environments with physical security controls, increasing the redundancy count (from 5 to a higher number) by modifying the source code, adding external verification of cryptographic operations when possible, considering using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key operations.",CWE-1240

7419,CVE-2025-29780,,,,,DavidOsipov,"Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `feldman_vss` library contains timing side-channel vulnerabilities in its matrix operations, specifically within the `_find_secure_pivot` function and potentially other parts of `_secure_matrix_solve`. These vulnerabilities are due to Python's execution model, which does not guarantee constant-time execution. An attacker with the ability to measure the execution time of these functions (e.g., through repeated calls with carefully crafted inputs) could potentially recover secret information used in the Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. The `_find_secure_pivot` function, used during Gaussian elimination in `_secure_matrix_solve`, attempts to find a non-zero pivot element. However, the conditional statement `if matrix[row][col] != 0 and row_random < min_value:` has execution time that depends on the value of `matrix[row][col]`. This timing difference can be exploited by an attacker. The `constant_time_compare` function in this file also does not provide a constant-time guarantee. The Python implementation of matrix operations in the _find_secure_pivot and _secure_matrix_solve functions cannot guarantee constant-time execution, potentially leaking information about secret polynomial coefficients. An attacker with the ability to make precise timing measurements of these operations could potentially extract secret information through statistical analysis of execution times, though practical exploitation would require significant expertise and controlled execution environments. Successful exploitation of these timing side-channels could allow an attacker to recover secret keys or other sensitive information protected by the VSS scheme. This could lead to a complete compromise of the shared secret. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. As acknowledged in the library's documentation, these vulnerabilities cannot be adequately addressed in pure Python. In the short term, consider using this library only in environments where timing measurements by attackers are infeasible. In the medium term, implement your own wrappers around critical operations using constant-time libraries in languages like Rust, Go, or C. In the long term, wait for the planned Rust implementation mentioned in the library documentation that will properly address these issues.",CWE-203
