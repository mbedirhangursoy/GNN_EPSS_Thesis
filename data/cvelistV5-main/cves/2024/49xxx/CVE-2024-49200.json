A potential DXE memory corruption vulnerability has been identified. The root cause is use of a pointer originating from the value of an NVRAM variable as the target of a write operation. This can be leveraged by an attacker to perform arbitrary writes, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue has been fixed in kernel 5.2, Version 05.29.44; kernel 5.3, Version 05.38.44; kernel 5.4, Version 05.46.44; kernel 5.5, Version 05.54.44; kernel 5.6, Version 05.61.44; and kernel 5.7, Version 05.70.44."
